# WEEK 1 RECAP: THE FOUNDATION IS POURED

This week marked the beginning of my 12-month journey, transitioning from zero experience to building a solid foundation in web development. The focus was on HTML structure, CSS styling, and professional Git workflow.

## üèÜ Key Achievements & Milestones

- **Project Initialization:** Successfully set up a detailed 12-month learning directory, initialized a Git repository, and connected it to GitHub.
- **Automation Scripts:** Built and implemented custom shell scripts (`commit_and_notify.sh`, `daily_reminder.sh`) for a professional, consistent workflow.
- **Portfolio v1.0:** Designed and built the first version of my personal portfolio page. This wasn't just a simple exercise; it became a comprehensive project that evolved daily.
- **The "Skills Matrix":** Iterated through multiple design revisions to create a professional, symmetrical, and responsive "Skills" component using modern CSS techniques like Grid, Flexbox previews, and scoped CSS Variables.

## üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Biggest Challenges

- **Git Divergent Branches:** Encountered and successfully resolved my first `rejected push` due to divergent histories between my local and remote repository. This was a challenging but invaluable real-world lesson.
- **CSS Layout Asymmetry:** Struggled with visual alignment issues in the multi-column layout. Debugging this taught me the critical difference between `display: flex` and `display: grid` for different layout problems.
- **Information Overload:** Keeping track of new concepts like the Box Model, Git branching, and CSS selectors simultaneously was demanding.

## üí° Core Learnings & Takeaways

- **Trust Your Eye:** If a design feels "off," it probably is. I've learned to be meticulous about details like alignment and symmetry.
- **Code Must Be Clean, Not Just Functional:** The refactoring of the `.project-card` styles taught me that maintainable code is as important as working code.
- **Git is a Safety Net, Not an Obstacle:** I now see Git branching as a tool for fearless experimentation, not just a way to save code.

### **Plan for Next Week:**
- Dive deep into **CSS Flexbox and Grid** to truly master layout.
- Begin learning the fundamentals of **JavaScript**, moving from a static page to an interactive one
